# Utility CSS
### Some simple rules and helper classes to make life a little easier

Whenever I start a new project, I find myself rewriting a lot of little utility rules and classes to help out with the build of a site. I decided to collect this into a little repo to keep track of them and pull down and use whenever I need it. 

This is not a recent, for that I recommend [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/). It is a simple addition that adds things like a good box-model, simple floats and clearing, some text-alignment classes, and a few responsive design helpers. 

I will expand and update as projects consistently call for things.
